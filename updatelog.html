            <h3 style="text-align: center">2019-08-21: Decreased simulation loading time</h3>
            <p>When clicking on the "Start" button to simulate a sketch in LogiJS, multiple things have to be
                done in the background. These include grouping the individual wires into logical structures and
                "sticking" the other elements to those wire groups.
                I managed to decrease the workload and time to execute these tasks to a fraction of what it was before.
                Therefore, even relatively big sketches can now be executed almost instantly.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center">2019-08-15: Added support for multi-line labels</h3>
            <p>Text labels are a nice way to keep your sketch organized and to include messages as a guidance on how to
                use the sketch.
                Since the last update, labels can include multiple lines of text instead of just one line. When clicking
                on the label,
                the properties menu now includes a text area where you can enter as much text as you want. The label
                will adjust it's height
                and width according to the number of lines and the length of the longest line.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center">2019-08-13: New designs for inputs and outputs</h3>
            <p>I have added a glare effect to the input and output elements. I was experimenting with different effects
                and
                this one convinced me because it's simple and fast to apply and it fits both in- and output elements.
                Also, the clock now has a clock finger symbol on it. This makes it easier to identify and looks better
                than
                the circle symbol in my opinion. I've acted very careful when adding those effects to not harm the
                simplified
                look of LogiJS but I think they are subtle enough the way they are now.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center">2019-08-07: Cache for loaded elements and new loading screen</h3>
            <p>When you are loading a LogiJS sketch from file, this file may contain other files that are included as
                custom objects. Those files may also have custom objects and so on.
                This hierarchy of dependencies can grow to a tree like structure where the same component
                is used very often in more complex custom objects. Before today, those components would be loaded from
                file every time. This is highly inefficient and therefore I built a cache for components that have
                already
                been loaded. The catch is though, that I had to serialize the loading process, meaning that one
                component
                is loaded after the other, instead of multiple things happening at once. Therefore, the loading speed
                isn't
                that much higher but the amount of data transferred from the server is much smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
                The upside of the serialized loading is that I had the chance to integrate a loading screen that shows
                up
                when a sketch is loading and vanishes afterwards. Because of the tree like dependencies I spoke of, I
                can't
                really tell how much of the sketch still has to load. Therefore, I can't show a loading percentage at
                the moment.
