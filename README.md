### Please note:

LogiJS development is currently in an indefinite hold in favor of its spiritual successor [Linkuit Studio](https://github.com/SimonBuxx/Linkuit-Studio). Linkuit Studio is a logic circuit simulator comparable to LogiJS but running as a native Windows application. 

While it still misses some features present in LogiJS, Linkuit Studio is much more stable and maintainable than LogiJS. If you like LogiJS, give [Linkuit Studio](https://github.com/SimonBuxx/Linkuit-Studio) a try.

Issues in this project won't be fixed by me at the moment. But thank you to everyone who is sharing their ideas and creating bug reports.

# LogiJS - Logic Circuit Simulation
![xor_animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6598913/111069437-5be79d80-84cd-11eb-90d4-ade8780d9feb.gif)

LogiJS is an open source logic ciruit simulation webapp. 
Focused on educational purposes, its applications range from experiments with basic logic circuits to complex CPU design.

My goal is to make LogiJS as user-friendly and performant as possible while providing all features expected by educational facilities.
For the near future, please excuse minor bugs, performance issues or rapid changes in design and functionality.
The software is still under development and I'm trying to improve it every day.
