### Please note: LogiJS development is currently in an indefinite hold in favor of another upcoming project. 
I am thankful for this huge learning opportunity and all the feedback I got over the years. I will be back - with news on this project or another.

## LogiJS - Logic Circuit Simulation
**https://logijs.com/**

LogiJS is an open source logic ciruit simulation webapp. 
Focused on educational purposes, its applications range from experiments with basic logic circuits to complex CPU design.

My goal is to make LogiJS as user-friendly and performant as possible while providing all features expected by educational facilities.
For the near future, please excuse minor bugs, performance issues or rapid changes in design and functionality.
The software is still under development and I'm trying to improve it every day.
